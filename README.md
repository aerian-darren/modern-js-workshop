## Week 1: 😻 Hello Kitty 😻!

This week we got our environments set up, and talked about testing, modules, functions and array methods.

### Modules and testing

We started our local server with `npm run serve` and loaded our demo in the browser. We soon found our first error.
`week01.js` is missing! We created it, and found our next error: `run` could not be found. We created our function called `run` in `week01.js`, but it still wasn't found until we exported it.

```javascript
export function run() {}
```

We then took a look at `index.html` and `index.js` to see what was happening. We discovered a new type of script tag:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

This is the new ES module syntax, [which is now supported in most browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module). We took a look at `index.js` tosee the syntax for `import`, and saw where we were calling `run`.

```javascript
import { run as week01 } from "./week01.js";

week01();
```

Jumping back to `index.js`, we played with `console.log`, and tried logging a string. We saw that we could run the same code from the command line using node, by running `npm start`. We then started with Test-Driven Development. We ran `npm test` and saw that we had no tests yet, so we created `week01.test.js`. We talked about Matt's love of emojis, looked at the syntax for the Jest `it` function, and wrote a test for our first challenge:

```javascript
import { getEmoji } from "./week01.js";

it("returns an emoji when passed name", () => {
  expect(getEmoji("heart eyes cat")).toEqual("😻");
});
```

We cheated and made our test pass by creating a `getEmoji()` function that returns "😻" every time. We then found that Matt had helpfully provided everyone with a big list of emojis in `lib/emojis.js`. We looked at the default export syntax and the different way we import it (no curly brackets).

```javascript
import emojis from "./lib/emoji.js";
```

### Arrays and Objects

We used `console.log` to explore the big array of emojis. We looked at `for...in` and `for...of` loops. We looked at why we used `const` to declare the variable. We then created our first proper passing version of getEmoji, using `for...of`:

```javascript
export function getEmoji(name) {
  for (const emoji of emojis) {
    if (emoji.code === name) {
      return emoji.moji;
    }
  }
}
```

### Array methods and arrow functions

We talked out how we could refactor our function. We discussed why moving the "HOW" into a separate function can make it more re-usable, testable, readable and modular. We created `isTheRightEmoji` and saw it still worked, and then refactored it to be an anonymous function.

```javascript
const isTheRightEmoji = function(emoji, name) {
  return emoji.code === name;
};
```

We talked about how a function that returns true or false is called a _predicate_, and then looked at how arrays in JavaScript have lots of useful methods for manipulating them, which are usually faster than rolling your own functions. We refactored `getEmoji` to use our `isTheRightEmoji` predicate. We discussed why we had to declare a function inside the `getEmoji` function (so that we have access to the `name` variable).

```javascript
export function getEmoji(name) {
    const emoji = emojis.find(function (item) {
        return isTheRightEmoji(item, name));
    });
    return emoji.moji;
}
```

We then looked at arrow functions, and the shorthand syntax for these, and saw how it could make more readable code, even though the syntax looks a bit 👽 at first.

```javascript
export function getEmoji(name) {
  const emoji = emojis.find(item => isTheRightEmoji(item, name));
  return emoji.moji;
}
```

## Week 02: 🐶 A Game of Fetch 🐶

![Stop trying to make fetch happen](https://media.giphy.com/media/5G98t8QjqBLK8/giphy.gif)

### Variables: `let` vs `const`

After reviewing last week, we started by looking at the difference between `let` and `const`. We use `let` if we want to change the value, and `const` if we won't. We explored this by trying to increment the value of a `const` and saw that it caused an error.
We created an empty array using the `[]` syntax and an empty object using `{}`, and saw that even with `const`, we were able to change the contents of the array or object.

### Shorthand object syntax

We saw that the common case of creating an object and assigning keys using variables of the same name can be done in a shorthand way.

```javascript
const foo = 1;
const bar = 2;

const obj = { foo, bar }; // = {foo: 1, bar: 2}.
// Equivalent to {foo: foo, bar: bar}
```

### Destructuring and the rest operator

Destructuring assignment allows us to quickly extract values from an object or array into new variables.

```javascript
const obj = { foo: 1, bar: "hello", baz: 20 };

const { foo, bar } = obj;

console.log(foo); // 1
console.log(bar); // "hello"

const arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9];

const [first, second] = arr;

console.log(first); // 1
console.log(second); // 3
```

The rest operator (`...`) allows us to capture the rest of the properties of entries of an array or object when we have used destructing assignment:

```javascript
const obj = { foo: 1, bar: "hello", baz: 20 };

const { foo, ...restObj } = obj;

console.log(foo); // 1
console.log(restObj); // {bar: "hello", baz: 20}

const arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9];

const [first, second, ...restArr] = arr;

console.log(first); // 1
console.log(...restArr); // [5, 7, 9]
```

### Exercise: find the dog

Sadly Ben wasn't with us, but we knew he wanted to find the dog emoji, so we copied our tests from last week and changed the cat with heart eyes to the dog.

```javascript
it("returns a dog emoji when passed 'dog'", () => {
  expect(getEmoji("dog")).toEqual("🐶");
});
//  FAIL  ./week02.test.js
```

### fetch, async and await

Unfortunately our list of emojis didn't include the dog, so we had to look for a better source. The Emojidex API fit the bill. We decided to extract your emoji fetching into a new function. We introduced the `fetch` API, which is an easy way to perform HTTP requests, and is supported by all modern browsers.

![they made fetch happen](https://i.imgur.com/bnPIoWu.png)

Unfortunately, fetch doesn't work in Node, so we installed a Polyfill: a small library that fills in holes in API support. We import it into our test file [using a different syntax](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html#import-a-module-for-side-effects-only):

`import "polymorphic-unfetch";`

...because we only need its side-effects (it adds a `fetch` method to the global space).

Fetch has a nice simple syntax: `fetch("https://cdn.emojidex.com/static/utf_emoji.json")`
We tried this, and found that instead of returning our data it returned a Promise. We talked about how a Promise was like a receipt given to you when you pay for your coffee. You take it to the counter and collect your coffee when it's ready. In ~~the olden days~~ 2015, this meant you had to use quite a complicated syntax, but luckily we're in 2018 and can use `async` and `await`. We talked about how if you put `async` before the function then you can just use await and write your code as if it was synchronous.

```javascript
export const fetchEmojis = async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://cdn.emojidex.com/static/utf_emoji.json");
    const emojis = await response.json();
    ...
}
```

We talked about how an async function returns a promise, but if you return a normal value it is magically wrapped in a promise for you. However there is no need to await a value if you're about to return it: it's fine to return the promise directly:

```javascript
export const fetchEmojis = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(
    "https://cdn.emojidex.com/static/utf_emoji.json"
  );
  return response.json();
};
```

We then refactored our `getEmoji` function from last week to be async, and get our emojis using fetch:

```javascript
export async function getEmoji(name) {
  const emojis = await fetchEmojis();
  const emoji = emojis.find(item => isTheRightEmoji(item, name));
  if (emoji) {
    return getTheMoji(emoji);
  }
}
```

We then saw that our test function also needed to now be async, but this was a simple change:

```javascript
it("returns a dog emoji when passed 'dog'", async () => {
  expect(await getEmoji("dog")).toEqual("🐶");
});
```

### Exercise: Everybody rocks

For our next exercise we needed to find several emojis and combine them into a single string. We started with the test:

```javascript
it("returns all of the emojis with the given base", async () => {
  expect(await allYourBase("sign_of_the_horns")).toEqual("🤘🤘🏼🤘🏽🤘🏾🤘🏿🤘🏻");
});
```

By looking at our emoji data, we saw that we would need to find all emojis whose `base` property matched the one we were looking for. To do this, we introduce the array filter method. This is passed a predicate, like `find()` which we used last week, but instead of returning the first item it finds, it returns an array of all found items.

```javascript
export const allYourBase = async base => {
  const emojis = await fetchEmojis();
  const filtered = emojis.filter(item => item.base === base);
  return filtered;
};
```

This found all of the emojis, but returned the whole objects, when we just want to emoji characters themselves. For this we introduced the array map function. Map is passed a function and returns a new array containing the result of calling the function on each item in the array. This allows us to extract the emoji character from the object.

```javascript
export const allYourBase = async base => {
  const emojis = await fetchEmojis();
  const filtered = emojis.filter(item => item.base === base).map(item => {
    return item.moji;
  });
  return filtered;
};
```

We then extracted that map function into a separate function, as this allows us to test it, and to easily change it if the API changes. We used the short array function syntax.

```javascript
export const getTheMoji = emoji => emoji.moji;

export const allYourBase = async base => {
  const emojis = await fetchEmojis();
  const filtered = emojis.filter(item => item.base === base).map(getTheMoji);
  return filtered;
};
// ["🤘","🤘🏼", "🤘🏽", "🤘🏾", "🤘🏿", "🤘🏻"]
```

This successfully gave us an array of emoji characters. However we want it as a single string. For this we introduced the array `reduce` method, which reduces an array to a single value. The method is passed a function that accepts the previous and current value. It is optionally passed a starting value. We saw that if we left this off, the function is first called with the first two values, which works in some cases, but not if you want to change the type of the value. For this reason it's good practice to always specify a starting value. For us, we specified an empty string, as we'll be concatenating each value with the last one.

```javascript
export const getTheMoji = emoji => emoji.moji;

export const allYourBase = async base => {
  const emojis = await fetchEmojis();
  const filtered = emojis
    .filter(item => item.base === base)
    .map(getTheMoji)
    .reduce((previous, current) => {
      return previous + current;
    }, "");
  return filtered;
};

// 🤘🤘🏼🤘🏽🤘🏾🤘🏿🤘🏻
```

This passes the test! However we saw that this involves looping through the array twice. While this is fine here as the array is short, we can refactor this to be more efficient, by taking the transform out of map and putting it into reduce. Luckily, as we extracted it into a separate function, this is simple:

```javascript
export const allYourBase = async base => {
  const emojis = await fetchEmojis();

  return emojis
    .filter(item => item.base === base)
    .reduce((previous, current) => {
      return previous + getTheMoji(current);
    }, "");
};
// 🤘🤘🏼🤘🏽🤘🏾🤘🏿🤘🏻
```

A little refactor gives us this neater version:

```javascript
export const allYourBase = async base => {
  const emojis = await fetchEmojis();

  return emojis
    .filter(item => item.base === base)
    .reduce((previous, current) => previous + getTheMoji(current), "");
};
```

Ta-da!

## Week 03: 💂 Standing guard 💂

This week is all about code quality and tooling. For this workshop we all installed [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and looked at some of the tools we can use to help improve our code.

### Coding standards

Coding standards help ensure everyone is familiar with the codebase and reduce barriers to entry for new devs. They help prevent git conflicts from e.g. changing tabs/spaces, and reduce thinking time when looking at someone else's code.

The biggest downside is that it can be extra work, and it can feel like you're being nagged. To demonstrate this, we installed [the ESLint extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), by clicking the extensions tab in the sidebar and searching ESLint. Once installed, we can see that it complains about lots of things in our code. This can be annoying, but we can auto-fix lots of these problems. If we install [the Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) we can look at how code formatters can make it even easier, especially if they are set to format on save. Open VS Code preferences and set `"editor.formatOnSave": true` and see it magically reformat all of our code. We can manually fix the remaining warnings, which is a much less daunting task. The remaining issues are mostly things unrelated to formatting, such as not consistently returning from a function, or using `let` instead of `const`.

### Side-effects and pure functions

Side-effects are things outside our function that effect it or are effected by it. For example, calling an API is a side-effect, as is writing to the console. These can make it harder to test functions, as we could end up effectively testing someone else's code instead of our own. We don't want our tests to fail if the network goes down. We want our tests to have the same result every time we run them. FOr these reasons, it's best to keep the number of functions with side-effects to a minimum.

A function that always returns the same value when passed the same input, and doesn't change anything except via its return value is called a pure function. While it's best to make as many of our functions pure as is possible, if our code is all pure then it won't do anything. So, while we need side-effects if we're to actually do anything, it's best to keep these isolated so we can keep an eye on them.

### Mocking

It can be hard to test functions that have side-effects, which is why we use mocks. A mock replaces a function that has side effects with a dummy one that is pure. For our example, in our project we can replace our `fetch` polyfill with a mock that returns a fixed JSON object. We put the mock into a directory called `__mocks__` next to our `node_modules` directory. We add `jest.mock("isomorphic-unfetch")`, which tells Jest to use our mock version instead of the real fetch polyfill.

### Exercise: the changing of the guard

We want to re-use our emoji functions from previous weeks, so rather than copying them or pulling them in from the previous weeks' files, we move them into a new `emojilib` library, which we move to the `lib` directory.

One common side-effect that we need to deal with is adding or changing content on an HTML page. Our exercise this week is to write a function that adds our emojis into the `<h1>` in the page. We want to write our test first, but as we're not running in a browser our first attempt will fail.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<h1 id='heading'></h1>
```

```javascript
it("inserts our emoji into the header", async () => {
  const emojis = await allYourBase("guardsman");
  await insertEmoji(emojis);
  expect(document.body.innerHTML).toEqual("<h1 id='heading'>💂🏻💂🏼💂🏽💂🏾💂🏿💂</h1>");
});
// TypeError: cannot set property innerHTML of null
```

Luckily, Jest comes bundled with [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom), which emulates the DOM in JavaScript. A small change allows our code to work. We update the test and implement `insertEmoji`

```javascript
// emojilib.js

export const insertEmoji = emoji => {
  const h1 = document.getElementById("heading");
  h1.innerHTML = emoji;
};
```

We'll test this by checking the resulting HTML.

```javascript
// week03.test.js
it("inserts our emoji into the header", async () => {
  document.body.innerHTML = "<h1 id='heading'></h1>";
  const emojis = await allYourBase("guardsman");
  await insertEmoji(emojis);
  expect(document.body.innerHTML).toEqual("<h1 id='heading'>💂🏻💂🏼💂🏽💂🏾💂🏿💂</h1>");
});
// Expected value to equal: "<h1 id='heading'>💂🏻💂🏼💂🏽💂🏾💂🏿💂</h1>",
// Received "<h1 id=\"heading\">💂🏻💂🏼💂🏽💂🏾💂🏿💂</h1>"
```

But wait..this still breaks. jsdom has changed the HTML to use double quotes. Rather than trying to work out what the HTML will be generated will look like, we can introduce snapshot tests.

#### Snapshot tests

A snapshot test checks that an output value does not change. The first time the test is run, the output is saved as a `.snap` file, which we check into git. If future updates change this output then the test will fail.

```javascript
it("inserts our emoji into the header", async () => {
  document.body.innerHTML = "<h1 id='heading'></h1>";
  const emojis = await allYourBase("guardsman");
  insertEmoji(emojis);
  expect(document.body.innerHTML).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

The syntax is very simple, and it handles all of the saving to disk automatically. We can see that a new `__snapshots__` directory is created with a new file `week03.test.js.snap`.

```
// Jest Snapshot v1, https://goo.gl/fbAQLP

exports[`inserts our emoji into the header 1`] = `"<h1 id=\\"heading\\">💂🏻💂🏼💂🏽💂🏾💂🏿💂</h1>"`;
```

If we ever need to change the saved value, we can run `npx jest --updateSnapshot` to update the snapshot.
