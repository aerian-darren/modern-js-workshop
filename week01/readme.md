## Week 1: ðŸ˜» Hello Kitty ðŸ˜»!

This week we got our environments set up, and talked about testing, modules,
functions and array methods.

### Modules and testing

We start our local server with `npm run serve` and load our demo in the browser
at http://localhost:1337. We soon find our first error. `week01.js` is missing!
Create it, and find the next error: `run` could not be found. We create our
function called `run` in `week01.js`, but it still can't be found until we
export it.

```javascript
export function run() {}
```

If we take a look at `index.html` and `index.js` to see what was happening we
can see a new type of script tag:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

This is the new ES module syntax,
[which is now supported in most browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module).
Take a look at `index.js` to see the syntax for `import`, and see where we are
calling `run`.

```javascript
import { run as week01 } from "./week01.js";

week01();
```

Next we can start Test-Driven Development!

Run `npm test` and we can see that we have no tests yet, so create
`week01.test.js`. Next we write a test for our first challenge.

```javascript
import { getEmoji } from "./week01.js";

it("returns an emoji when passed name", () => {
    expect(getEmoji("heart eyes cat")).toEqual("ðŸ˜»");
});
```

We can start by cheating and make our test pass by creating a `getEmoji()`
function that returns "ðŸ˜»" every time. Luckily there's a big list of emojis in
`lib/emojis.js` which we can use to find the real emoji. We can use the default
export syntax to import it (no curly brackets).

```javascript
import emojis from "./lib/emoji.js";
```

### Arrays and Objects

We can use `console.log` to explore the big array of emojis. We looked at
`for...in` and `for...of` loops. We looked at why we used `const` to declare the
variable. We then created our first proper passing version of getEmoji, using
`for...of`:

```javascript
export function getEmoji(name) {
    for (const emoji of emojis) {
        if (emoji.code === name) {
            return emoji.moji;
        }
    }
}
```

### Array methods and arrow functions

We talked out how we could refactor our function. We discussed why moving the
"HOW" into a separate function can make it more re-usable, testable, readable
and modular. We created `isTheRightEmoji` and saw it still worked, and then
refactored it to be an anonymous function.

```javascript
const isTheRightEmoji = function(emoji, name) {
    return emoji.code === name;
};
```

We talked about how a function that returns true or false is called a
_predicate_, and then looked at how arrays in JavaScript have lots of useful
methods for manipulating them, which are usually faster than rolling your own
functions. We refactored `getEmoji` to use our `isTheRightEmoji` predicate. We
discussed why we had to declare a function inside the `getEmoji` function (so
that we have access to the `name` variable).

```javascript
export function getEmoji(name) {
    const emoji = emojis.find(function (item) {
        return isTheRightEmoji(item, name));
    });
    return emoji.moji;
}
```

We then looked at arrow functions, and the shorthand syntax for these, and saw
how it could make more readable code, even though the syntax looks a bit ðŸ‘½ at
first.

```javascript
export function getEmoji(name) {
    const emoji = emojis.find((item) => isTheRightEmoji(item, name));
    return emoji.moji;
}
```
