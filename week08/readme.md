## Week 8

This week you have a task to complete. Our emoji keyboard from last week is
amazing of course, but what if we want different categories? Your task is to use
the skills you have learnt over the past two months to build an emoji keyboard
that you can filter by category.

You can build it in any way that you want, but we have some things that would be
great to see if possible. Don't get hung up on any of this though. Most of all
we'd like to see something working. You can refactor it later.

### Top tips

*   Find the categories from emoji list.
*   Break down the task into small functions, preferably pure, that only try to
    do one thing. Try to keep the impure stuff in one or two places.
*   Lots of tests!
*   map/filter/reduce are your friends
*   Try using composition, with `compose` or `pipe`.
*   There are lots of helpful functions already in emojilib and in previous
    weeks' files.
*   It would be great if we could load from emojidex as well as our local emoji
    list. Maybe let us choose?
